Ultra-Efficient MLOps Python for Data Automation Syllabus (Most Practical & DevOps-Integrated):

Day 1: Log Data Ingestion - Quick Start (Visual & Copy-Paste)

Concepts: Load CSV logs, print first 5 rows, show data types.
DevOps Analogy: Like viewing server logs in a terminal.
Action:
pip install pandas numpy
Code Snippet:
Python

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("training_logs.csv")
print(df.head())
print(df.dtypes)
Visual: Show a sample CSV log and the output of df.head().
Day 2: Log Cleaning - Automated Function (Reusable & Modifiable)

Concepts: Create a function to replace missing values, convert data types.
DevOps Analogy: Like creating a reusable script for log cleaning.
Action:
Code Snippet:
Python

def clean_log(df):
    df['accuracy'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
    df['epoch'] = df['epoch'].astype(int)
    return df
Visual: Show a "before" and "after" view of the log.
Day 3: Log Summarization - Direct CSV Output (Immediate Reporting)

Concepts: Use groupby and pivot_table to create summary tables, save to CSV.
DevOps Analogy: Like generating a system performance report.
Action:
Code Snippet:
Python

summary = df.groupby('epoch')['accuracy'].mean().reset_index()
summary.to_csv("summary.csv")
Visual: Show a sample CSV output.
Day 4: Log Visualization - Automated PNGs (Visual Monitoring)

Concepts: Create plots of accuracy/loss, save as PNGs.
DevOps Analogy: Like creating graphs for a monitoring dashboard.
Action:
Code Snippet:
Python

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(df['epoch'], df['accuracy'])
plt.savefig("accuracy.png")
Visual: Show a sample plot.
Day 5: Basic Model Prototyping - Quick Evaluation (Immediate Feedback)

Concepts: Train a logistic regression model, print accuracy.
DevOps Analogy: Like running a quick test script.
Action:
Code Snippet:
Python

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
# ... (train model)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
Visual: Show the output of the accuracy print.
Day 6: Model Preprocessing - "Copy & Modify" (Configuration)

Concepts: Use StandardScaler and OneHotEncoder, retrain the model.
DevOps Analogy: Like configuring data for optimal model performance.
Action:
Code Snippet:
Python

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
# ... (scale and encode)
Visual: Show a "before" and "after" view of the data.
Day 7: End-to-End Automation - CI/CD Integration (Pipeline Focus)

Concepts: Write a script to automate everything, save to JSON.
DevOps Analogy: Like building a CI/CD pipeline.
Action:
Code Snippet: (Full script provided as a template)
Integration: Show how this script can be integrated into a GitHub Actions workflow.
Day 8: CLI Tool - Real-World Usage (Tool Building)

Concepts: Build a CLI tool with argparse, output reports/visuals.
DevOps Analogy: Like building a custom DevOps utility.
Action:
Code Snippet: (Example using argparse)
Visual: Show the CLI tool's output.
Key Changes for Maximum Ease & Expertise:

Visual Learning: Use more visuals to illustrate concepts.
Code Snippets: Provide more "copy & modify" code snippets.
Real-World Integration: Integrate with CI/CD early.
Micro-Steps: Break down tasks into even smaller, actionable steps.
Direct Output: Focus on directly producing usable output (CSV, JSON, PNG).
This approach prioritizes immediate application and visual learning, making the transition to MLOps as smooth and efficient as possible.
